# Haivision KB Encoder

This module will allow you to control functions of a Haivision KB Encoder/Transcoder.
**Note: It uses the web API, not the KB REST API (ECS) as documented/provided by Haivision.**

Limitations of the ECS API prevent the user from controlling channels created manually through the standard web interface. Using the Web API allows you to circumvent this issue.

## Configuration
* The IP Address of the device.
* The Username to login
* The Password to login

## Actions
* Start/Stop Channel
* Start/Stop All Channels
* Arm/Disarm Recording
